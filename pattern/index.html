<!-- pattern="^[a-zA-Z]*$"
 A to Z - uppercase or lowercase with no numbers or special characters -->
 <!-- This is considered a regular expression and you are able to use it in other languages too -->
  <!-- teacher's advice: These patterns are IMPOSSIBLE to memorize (or really really hard) do not spend a lot of brain power trying to memorize regex patterns. Want to include or exclude something? Just google it -->
